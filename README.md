# QnATrainingKnowledge-base
# Document Processing and Question-Answering Application

## Overview

This application is designed to extract, process, and analyze text data from various documents stored in a zip archive. It primarily utilizes text generation and retrieval-based question-answering capabilities to interactively answer questions based on the document contents. It's particularly useful for scenarios where rapid processing and querying of large text datasets are required.

## Features

- **Document Extraction:** Automatically extracts documents from a zip file stored in Google Drive.
- **Text Processing:** Utilizes text generation capabilities to process and respond to queries based on the extracted text.
- **Interactive Question Answering:** Implements a retrieval-based question-answering system using embeddings and a vectorized database to answer user queries.
- **Efficient Text Splitting and Embedding:** Splits documents into manageable chunks and uses advanced embeddings for efficient retrieval.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install langchain tiktoken chromadb pypdf transformers InstructorEmbedding accelerate bitsandbytes sentencepiece Xformers
```

## Usage

1. Mount your Google Drive to access the zip file containing the documents.
2. Execute the script to extract documents, process them, and set up the environment for question answering.
3. Use the interactive prompt to ask questions about the content of the documents.

## Dependencies

- **langchain:** For building LLM-based applications.
- **transformers:** For utilizing pre-trained models like LlamaForCausalLM.
- **sentence_transformers, Chroma:** For text embeddings and vector storage.
- **pypdf:** For processing PDF files.
- **InstructorEmbedding:** For specialized instruction embeddings.

## Example Queries

# full example
query = "what are the steps for calculating debt from cencus"
llm_response = qa_chain(query)
process_llm_response(llm_response)

Response:
To calculate debt from census data using CalARM, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a provider and facility record in CalARM. This will allow you to track the facility's
information and history.

Step 2: Enter the census data into CalARM. This should include the number of resident days for the month, as
well as any other relevant information such as program type, case record type, and status.

Step 3: Review the census data for accuracy and completeness. If there are any errors or omissions, you may
need to resubmit the data or contact the facility to obtain missing information.

Step 4: Once the census data has been reviewed and verified, CalARM will calculate the debt owed by the
facility based on the resident days and other factors.

Step 5: If there are errors or discrepancies in the census data, CalARM will flag the task and create a
request for the facility to resubmit the data or provide additional information.

Step 6: If the census data is accurate and complete, CalARM will notify the facility of the amount owed and
any outstanding balances.

Step 7: If the facility disputes the debt amount, they may choose to appeal the decision through the CalARM
system.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

query = "how do I enter in the bed days for a facility?"
llm_response = qa_chain(query)
process_llm_response(llm_response)

Response:
 To enter bed days for a facility in CalARM, you would need to create a new census case for the facility and
input the necessary information such as the facility name, contact person, and start date of the census
period. Once you have created the census case, you can input the total number of resident days for the
facility during the census period. This can be done by either manually entering the data or importing it from
another source. After the data has been entered, CalARM will calculate the amount due based on the
reimbursement rate set by the state.
